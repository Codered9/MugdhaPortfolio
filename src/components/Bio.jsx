            <p className="">Currently crafting fintech experiences at Oracle, helping banks feel just a little more human. As a designer, I love figuring out how people navigate their daily lives & make decisions, often noticing the small details that shape their behaviour.</p>
            <p className="mt-8">Iâ€™m always asking why, testing what if, and learning from oops. These observations help me create designs which are scroll-worthy, tap-happy experiences, where every detail has a reason and every interacton just makes sense.</p>
